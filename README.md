SwarmGrid is a decentralized simulation platform where autonomous agents allocate and trade resources without central control. It models emergent behaviors in distributed systems, supports customizable agents and scenarios, and is ideal for studying swarm intelligence, multi-agent systems, and resource dynamics.
